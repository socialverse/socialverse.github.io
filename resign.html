                <p>i'm lost, swimming in the doubt of those empty eyes</p>

                <p>i'm scared, not knowing how to act but the tremble would suffice</p>

                <p>days are brighter outside this shell, summer, heat, and sunshine</p>

                <p>but the fingers on this dead poet's hand is about to consign</p>
                    <br>
                <p>to agree, that the meaty vine is not as creative as it has been</p>

                <p>to adapt to the slowness of thinking</p>

                <p>and catch up and still be satisfied with everything revolving</p>

                <p>to stay, accept, and rebel against things changing</p>
                    <br>
                <p>the purpose has changed: it's not about expressing anymore</p>

                <p>but writing, and reflecting, and still what it is before</p>

                <p>to let go and be freed. to catch and be ensnared</p>

                <p>in the end, to stumble with satisfaction in my fashioned bed.</p>
