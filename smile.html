				<p>Your smile was a lie</p>
                <p>After your heart was thrown out</p>
                <p>Crushed and abandoned</p>
                <p>By people you thought</p>
                <p>Could've been your savior.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Your smile was a lie</p>
                <p>I knew it, but I couldn't</p>
                <p>Do anything about it</p>
                <p>I'm way beyond my boundary</p>
                <p>And your heartbeat didn't match mine.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Your smile will be a lie</p>
                <p>If you keep all your pain</p>
                <p>Bottled up inside.</p>
                <p>Know that I'm aware</p>
                <p>That you - enduring pain - are strong</p>
                <p>Yes, you're strong</p>
                <p>And strong people</p>
                <p>Must know that they, too, should</p>
                <p>cry. Their tears are</p>
                <p>The foundation of their strength.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Your smile will be a lie</p>
                <p>If you will keep on believing</p>
                <p>That strength comes from</p>
                <p>Endurance. Strength is not</p>
                <p>you enduring, but you knowing.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Their smile (of strong ones) will be a lie</p>
                <p>Only if, they stop being happy.</p>
