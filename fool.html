				<p>there must be a secret on how to determine                </p>
                <p>detect and examine that love is blooming
                </p>
                <p>there must be a way to know and understand
                </p>
                <p>that I am not confused but just neglecting
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>tell me so at once for I am in trouble
                </p>
                <p>speak it to my ears and let my heart understand
                </p>
                <p>that my way of analyzing is the other way around
                </p>
                <p>maybe, I am aware but afraid to own to it
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    perhaps there is a better way for me to accept
                </p>
                <p>that my heart has changed and it has been mended                </p>
                <p>that my lingering grudge has long passed away
                </p>
                <p>the erratic beat of my heart was because of someone else
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>maybe, my grudge and frustration were stronger than my love
                </p>
                <p>such a vile situation hindered my heart to be at peace
                </p>
                <p>if ever you see me crying, heal my heart. Touch it
                </p>
                <p>thaw the unrequited love that built up around it
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>if you see me walking in the rain, don't bring me an umbrella
                </p>
                <p>if it's not too much to ask, play in the rain with me
                </p>
                <p>at least let me experience happiness in distress
                </p>
