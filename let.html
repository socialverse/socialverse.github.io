                    how embarrassing, he smiled on your face
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    when his heart was in conflict with his mind
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    he was keeping his cool but his hands were trembling
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    when she mentioned her previous heart.
                  </p>

                    unexpecting soul tried to dodge the dagger -
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    coming his way, only to pierce his heart!
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    you! cruel her! he was pleasing you!
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    never mention your previous heart, and whisper it in his ear
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <p>

                  <p>
                    he's a child dancing in your weather!
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    what you give gave his mood, be careful - he lives for you -
