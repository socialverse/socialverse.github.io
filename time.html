				<p>i was never the one to believe</p> 
                <p>the becoming of wish</p>
                <p>even the unfolding of expectation</p> 
                <p>with satisfaction and content</p>
                <br>
                <p>if ever, i will get the chance</p>
                <p>to witness this hope and wishes</p>
                <p>happening in front of my eyes</p>
                <p>i would wish to witness, one faithful thing</p>
                <br>
                <p>to get back to that time</p> 
                <p>when the rhythm is slower</p>
                <p>to go to a time</p>
                <p>where i wouldn't have to worry about losing it.</p>
                <br>
                <p>a time where i can stop a moment and live in it for a while</p>
                <p>and be glad about things happening and moving forward</p>
                <p>creating a more precious memory where i would wish to stay longer</p>
                <p>and be creative and satisfied about everything happening.</p>
                <br>
                <p>a time where i don't have to live in memory but with it</p>
                <p>happening and unfolding with my own time</p>
                <p>so that i wouldn't have to be so afraid about my present</p>
                <p>and see my family and friends with me living life at their own pace</p>
